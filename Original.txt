Basic Plot:

As a young man, Enfundin was a powerful wizard who fought dark creatures and saved damsels in distress from certain doom...and enjoyed it. But time and the nature of man have led him to become disillusioned with the material world which surrounds him and retreat to live the life of a hermit in a forest cave. There he writes books and paints waterfalls, and plans to live out his old age in peace from the rest of the world, his wizardly ways now largely forgotten and a thing of the past. His only friend in the forest is a wood nymph named Wryxan, as adept with a bow as she is beautiful.

When Wryxan disappears, however, Enfundin is forced to choose between the quiet life he loves and rescuing his friend. Learning that she has been kidnapped by the dark mage Calzor, whose forces are ravaging the world, he vows to save her, no matter the cost.

But the wizardly art that came so naturally to him in his youth is no longer and he must first regain it if he is to fight Calzor. Relying on wits alone, he must travel across the war-torn earth to the fabled wizard academy of Quindu, there to be reborn at a terrible price, before returning to confront his enemy at last in the dank mines of Zerathon.

==========
The Hermit
==========

Deep within the sprawling forest of Elucippa, there lay a hidden waterfall. There, the dappled light shone joyfully through the leaves; splintered by the water, it twisted and turned, bathing the rocks in a soft multi-coloured glow. There, the crash of water and the chirping of the birds mingled into one, and the air was laden heavy with the scent of the new spring. There, an old man could find peace.

He sat there now upon a wizened tree stump, brush in hand, his keen eyes darting between the waterfall and the canvas perched precariously on the awkwardly-placed easel in front of him. A thick white beard clung rather desperately to his face, and his hooded brown robe was fraying somewhat at the edges, but, beneath his bushy brows, his eyes twinkled with the happiness of a man who at long last was in his element. His brush flicked carefully across the canvas: a dab here, a thicker stroke there, perhaps a smudge now and then with a wrinkled finger to add variety, all the time soaking up the atmosphere of this, his favourite retreat. For Enfundin, this forest was home.

He felt the warmth of the ground through his bare feet and the grass rustling against his toes. Occasionally an unripened nut would fall to either side of him from the branching hazel above his head, and he would glance up to see a squirrel looking somewhat crestfallen. Shaking his head rather amusedly, he would return to his work. He had never understood why squirrels did that.

At length, feeling the first spots of rain upon his brow, he packed up his easel and, pulling his thick woollen hood over his head, headed for home. There would be other days for painting.

***

Enfundin lived in a cave at the western edge of the forest. Set within a lightly-wooded valley, through which a quiet brook gently traced its meandering path, the cave had been damp and uninhabitable when he first discovered it. But with time and patience, he had slowly transformed it into a dwelling with some small degree of comfort. The roof still leaked slightly from time to time, but he was not a fastidious man, and was content to let it be.

Upon entering, a visitor - though he had few enough of those - would have observed it was a pleasant place. The floor was thickly covered with bracken, and many of the forest pictures he had painted covered the walls. To the left, a thin passageway receded into the darkness, marked only by a brightly painted sign saying "This way to the wine cellar!". To the right lay a side-cave where he retired to sleep. A recess in the back of the cave held a small fireplace, from which smoke could swirl lazily upwards through a rather makeshift sort of chimney in the rock. But it was the centre of the room that held his pride and joy: a beautifully-carved table and chairs he had fashioned from a fallen oak. The legs of the table were covered with all manner of animal carvings. At the top, birds flew lazily through the still air; at the bottom, deer wandered silently through the glade.

All in all, it was a homely little dwelling, and Enfundin was happy there. He entered now, wet to the bone, and rested his easel carefully against the wall. Lighting the fire, he threw off his sodden robe, lay down upon the bracken in front of the hearth and faded off to sleep.

===================
Flames over Osfalor
===================

The village of Osfalor was nestled against the northern rim of the forest, its southernmost houses all but enveloped by the trees. To the west, the snow-tipped peaks of the great Ilsian mountains rose, tall and shining, into the afternoon sky. Northwards, the rolling grasslands disappeared into the haze towards Isthenior, whilst to the south-east, the winding road led interminably to the bustling port of Menreith, and the sea.

This was Fallion's village, and it was homeward he wandered now, his feet squelching in the grime beneath the weight of the fallen wood he carried in a large wicker basket on his back. He was a young lad, no more than perhaps twelve or thirteen years of age, yet broad-shouldered and strong for all that. His light brown hair was tousled, and fell untidily across his muddied face. The ground had not yet dried from the previous day's rain, and occasionally one leg or the other would sink deeper into the boggy earth, casting him forwards and causing his load to rain unceremoniously about his ears. Cursing good-humouredly, he would free himself and gather it up again, revelling somewhat in the dirt he accumulated in the process, as small boys do.

He paused awhile beside a little stream as it carved its audacious path through the undergrowth. There was no hurry: his father had instructed him to be home by four, and the sun had only lately passed its zenith. Laying his basket to one side,  he sat down between the protruding roots of a large oak, kicked off his muddy boots and bathed his aching toes in the cool water.

In Osfalor, the fires still burned. Tall pillars of smoke rose high into the darkening sky from what remained of the thatched rooves of the cottages. A few hours before, the village had been a quiet backwater, where the people kept cattle and pigs, and lived out their lives in relative obscurity. Now the cattle were dead and the pigs had become bacon, and unknown men clad in chainmail sat casually around an open fire having their fill. Here and there villagers lay where they had fallen, TODO
